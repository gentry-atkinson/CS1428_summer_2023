You're going to fill out a rubric for every student.
Start by looking at their code file. You should be able to copy
and paste their name into their rubric.

####### Style Guide ########

1. Lines less than 80 characters:
    1 or 2 lines over: -1 point
    3 to 5 lines over: -2 points
    5 to 10 lines over: -3 points
    11+ lines over: -4 points

2. Variables have meaningfule names:
    Pretty much everyone gets full points for this.

3. Every block indented:
    1 or 2 lines not indented: full credit
    Some indenting but it's not consistent: -2 points
    Nothing indented: -3 points

4. Comments for complicated actions:
    More than 3 comments in their code: full credit
    1 or 2 comments: -1 point
    No comments after authorship comment: -2 points

5. File name is [Authors Last Name]_assignment1.cpp:
    Extra numbers in the name: -1 point
    Name is different but still has author's name in it: -2 points
    Name is completely different: -4 points    

6. Name and Date Comment:
    Name not included: -1 point
    Data not included: -1 point
    Collaborators not included:-1 point (but no more than -2 overall)

######## Test Cases ######

So this is where you're going to build and run their programs. If the code doesn't
compile you can fix one or two small issues for them. If the code won't compile and
there's no easy fix, email me the students name and I'll grade it as best I can.

This iteration of the project doesn't loop yet, so you'll have to run the program again for each test case.

1. Test Case 1
    Enter the inputs on the left. Their program should print "File written for
    Zoomer1" on the console. 
    Wrong message: -2 to -5 points
    Wrong file name: -5 points
    Prints nothing or crashes: -5 to -10 points depending on how "close" their code is

2. Test Case 2
    Console input should cause a file named "Boko.txt" to be written.
    Wrong file name: -5 points
    Printing file contents to console instead of file: -5 points
    Prints nothing or crashes: -5 to -10 points depending on how "close" their code is

3. Test Case 3
    Console input should produce the listed numbers.
    Incorrect values: -2 points apiece (if their more than +- 0.1 off)
    Wrong or missing units: -1 point apiece
    Sloppy columns: -5 points

4. Test Case 4
    Console input should produce the listed text.
    Header label missing: -5 points
    Header label has wrong name: -3 points
    Time stamp missing: -5 points
    Time stamp hard coded rather than calling time(NULL): -5 points
