You're going to fill out a rubric for every student.
Start by looking at their code file. You should be able to copy
and past their name into their rubric.

####### Style Guide ########

1. Lines less than 80 characters:
    1 or 2 lines over: -1 point
    3 to 5 lines over: -2 points
    5 to 10 lines over: -3 points
    11+ lines over: -4 points

2. Variables have meaningfule names:
    Pretty much everyone gets full points for this.

3. Every block indented:
    1 or 2 lines not indented: full credit
    Some indenting but it's not consistent: -2 points
    Nothing indented: -3 points

4. Comments for complicated actions:
    More than 5 comments in their code: full credit
    2 or 4 comments: -1 point
    No comments after authorship comment: -2 points

5. File name is...
    OK, I keep forgetting to update this entry in the rubric and that's my fault.
    So we will be accepting [Author's Last Name]_assignment and then any number.
    Any other name: -1 or -2 depending on how close it is

6. Name and Date Comment:
    Name not included: -1 point
    Data not included: -1 point



######## Code Refactor ########

Helper functions are allowed.
This section is about them writing function, not about the function
working correctly. Correctness will be covered by Test Cases.

1. Design, Test, and Simulate implemented as 1 function
    Function implemented partially: -1 or -2 point each
    Functions missing: -4 points each

2. Menu branch call 1 function each:
    Menu calls functions, but important code is still in main: -1 point
    Menu call functions but most of the work is still done in main: -2 points
    Menu doesn't call student-written functions: -4 points

3. Function Comments:
    This is their first time writing functions so the comments are going to be
    really inconsistent.
    Some functions missing comments - 2 points
    No function comments: -4 points 

######## Test Cases ######

So this is where you're going to build and run their programs. If the code doesn't
compile you can fix one or two small issues for them. If the code won't compile and
there's no easy fix, email me the students name.

1. Test Case 1, 2, and 3
    The first 3 test cases take console input, and then write a file. The correct
    file name is the top of the "Test Condition" Column. The student's program
    should produce a file with the same contents.
    Program doesn't return to menu after running: -1 points per case
    Program takes input in the wrong order: -1 point per case
    File name is wrong: -1 point per case
    Floats don't show 1 decimal: -1 point per case
    Other formatting issues: -1 point per case

2. Test Case 4, 5, 6
    The next 3 test cases read the files produced by test cases 1, 2, and 3. The
    program should then test the values in the file with some simple branching. The
    students should all do very well here, because this was part of Project 2.
    Failing more than one test: -1 point per case
    Program doesn't return to menu after running: -1 points per case
    Failing the wrong test: -2 points per case
    No ouput or file not found: -3 points per case
    Program crashes, seg faults, or other major failure: -5 points per case

3. Test Case 7
    This is not a valid menu option
    Program doesn't return to menu after running: -1 point
    Program does nothing: -3 points
    Program crashes, seg faults, or other major failure: -5 points per case

4. Test Case 8 and 9
    This option "simulates" a flight. The first number is acceleration and the
    second number is how many seconds to simulate the flight for. Case 8 should
    only print one line on the console. Case 9 should print 41 lines on the console.
    I gave them some leeway in how they align the columns so they can be right or
    left justified, but should be "neat".
    Sloppy columns: -1 point per case.
    Program doesn't return to menu after running: -1 point per case
    Numbers are not formatted to one decimal: -1 point per case
    Wrong units for output: -1 point per case
    Incorret values: -2 points per case (not per line)
    Wrong number of lines printed: -2 points per case
    No output: -10 points per case

5. Test Case 10
    The program should print the little "Thank You" message and then quit.
    Missing "Thank you" message: -2 points
    Nothing happens with 'q' as you input: -5 points
