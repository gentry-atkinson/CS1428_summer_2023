//Write a function called isPrime that takes one int as a parameter
//Return true if the int is prime, false otherwise

//Write a function called countFromTo that takes 2 ints as parameters
//Print every number from the first int to the second int inclusively

//Write a function called printBetweenPrimes that takes one int as a parameter
//Starting with 2 and 3, print every integer between each two consecutive primes
//Repeat until the bigger of the two primes is bigger than the parameter
//
//Example Output:
//printBetweenPrimes(11)
//2 3
//3 4 5
//5 6 7
//7 8 9 10 11
